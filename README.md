# 🕹️ Tic Tac Drop

Welcome to **Tic Tac Toe** with a special rule and new game modes!  
This version of the classic game features a **3-move active limit** and the option to challenge an **artificial intelligence** in two difficulty levels.

---

## 📋 How It Works

- The board is a **3x3 grid**.
- There are **two players**: `X` and `O` (you can play against another human or the CPU).
- On each turn, the player places their symbol by entering the cell coordinates (e.g., `A0`, `B2`).
- The goal is to align **3 symbols** in a row: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

If the board fills up and no one wins, the game ends in a **draw**.

---

## 🔥 Special Rule: Maximum 3 Active Moves

- Each player can have **at most 3 active symbols** on the grid.
- When a player makes a **fourth move**, their **oldest move** is **automatically removed**.

This rule adds a new layer of strategy to the game!

## 🧠 Game Modes

When starting the game, you can choose from three modes:

1. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Player vs Player**
2. 🤖 **Player vs CPU (Easy)** – the CPU plays randomly.
3. 🧠 **Player vs CPU (Hard)** – the CPU uses an intelligent strategy.
