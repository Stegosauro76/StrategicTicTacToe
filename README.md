🕹️ Tic Tac Toe - 3-Move Variant
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe with a twist!
In this special version of the classic game, each player can have only 3 active moves on the board at a time, making the gameplay more dynamic and strategic.

📋 How the Game Works
The board is a 3x3 grid.

There are two players: X and O.

Players take turns to place their symbol by entering a cell coordinate (e.g., A0, B2).

The goal is to align three of your symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

If the board is full and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.

🔥 Special Rule: Maximum 3 Active Moves
Each player can have at most 3 symbols on the board at any time.

If a player already has 3 symbols when they make a new move:

Their oldest symbol is automatically removed from the board.

This rule keeps the board changing and the strategy evolving!
